# Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms by Tim Roughgarden

# to do:
  - karatsuba alsorithm: 
    - [ ] update function name
    - [ ] using stack intead of function recurssion
    - [ ] re-write docstring
    
  - count inversion:
    - [ ] re-write docstring
    - [ ] using stack instead of function recurssion
    
  - quick sort:
    - [ ] re-write docstring
    - [ ] using stack instead of function recurssion
    
  - minimum cut:
    - [ ] re-write docstring
